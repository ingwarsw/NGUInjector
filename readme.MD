# NGUInjector

NGUInjector is an automation platform for the steam version of NGU Idle.

# Instructions

Releases can be found in the releases section of the github page [here](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/releases). The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/releases/latest). Do not download the source code archive, instead download the zip file with the release version in the name. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice. To start automation, run inject.bat in the extracted folder when NGU Idle is open. DO NOT RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.

You'll know the injection has worked if you see the following in the upper left portion of NGU.

To upgrade to a new release, restart NGU idle and run the inject script again.

# Configuration

After injecting the dll, a new folder will be created on your Desktop called NGUInjector. Settings files will be automatically written to this directory. The following files are of interest:

- **settings.json** - Contains settings used by the application. Most settings can be configured from the in-game menu.
- **allocation.json** - Breakpoints for assigning gear, magic, energy, wandoos OS, rebirth time, and diggers. See the allocation section for more information

A logs folder will also be created with the following files:

- **loot.log** - Logs all the loot dropped by enemies. Also logs money pit and daily spin results.
- **inject.log** - Logs general information about the injector
- **combat.log** - Logs information from the combat algorithm
- **allocation.log** - Logs information about allocating energy/magic/gear/diggers

Saving either file will automatically reload the settings in the configuration file. Reloading the game isn't necessary

# Allocation

The allocation.json file is a JSON file that contains time breakpoints for configuring your gear, diggers, energy allocation and magic allocation. Sample allocation files can be found in the sampleprofile folder.

[Sample 24 Hour Profile](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/blob/master/NGUInjector/SampleProfiles/24hr_with_gear.json).

The time portion of every breakpoint refers to rebirth time in seconds.

## Energy

An energy breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
{
"Time": 0,
"Priorities": ["CAPNGU-0", "CAPWAN", "AT-1", "NGU-1"]
}
```

Priorities come in 2 types - cap and non-cap. Any priority that has -X after it is 0 indexed.

When a cap priority is used, the equivalent of hitting the cap button will be used. If a cap button doesn't exist, the program will calculate an appropriate cap and attempt to BB for the next 10 seconds. If cap is higher than idle, all energy will be allocated to it. Cap priorities always run before regular priorities.
When a non-cap priority is used, remaining energy after cap priorities will be evenly divided between the allocations specified.

In the above example the following actions will be taken:

- NGU-0 (NGU Augments) will be capped
- Wandoos energy will be capped
- Remaining energy will be split between AT-1 (Advanced Training Power) and NGU-1 (NGU Wandoos)

Available cap priorities for Energy are as follows:

- CAPNGU-X (0-8) - Use the cap button for the NGU
- CAPALLNGU - Use the cap button for every NGU starting from 0
- CAPAT-X (0-4) - Calculate a cap for the AT and attempt to BB it.
- CAPWAN - Use the cap button for wandoos energy
- CAPTM - Calculate a cap for energy time machine and attempt to BB it.
- CAPBT-X (0-11) - Use the cap button for basic training
- CAPAUG-X (0-13) - Calculate a cap for augments and attempt to BB it

Available non-cap priorities for Energy are as follows:

- NGU-X (0-8) - Allocate energy to NGU
- AT-X (0-4) - Allocate energy to AT
- AUG-X (0-13) - Allocate energy to augment
- WAN - Allocate energy to energy wandoos
- TM - Allocate energy to energy time machine
- BT-X (0-11) - Allocate energy to basic training
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate energy to wish. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate too. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

More information on allocation indexes can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## Magic

A magic breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
{
"Time": 0,
"Priorities": ["CAPNGU-0", "CAPWAN", "BR", "NGU-1"]
}
```

Priorities come in 2 types - cap and non-cap. Any priority that has -X after it is 0 indexed.

When a cap priority is used, the equivalent of hitting the cap button will be used. If a cap button doesn't exist, the program will calculate an appropriate cap and attempt to BB for the next 10 seconds. Cap priorities always run before regular priorities.
When a non-cap priority is used, remaining magic after cap priorities will be evenly divided between the allocations specified.

In the above example the following actions will be taken:

- NGU-0 (NGU Yggdrasil) will be capped
- Wandoos magic will be capped
- Magic rituals will be capped from highest to lowest, with rituals taking more than 1 hour skipped
- Remaining magic will be allocated to NGU-1 (NGU Exp)

Available cap priorities for Magic are as follows:

- CAPNGU-X (0-6) - Use the cap button for the NGU
- CAPALLNGU - Use the cap button for every NGU starting from 0
- CAPWAN - Use the cap button for wandoos magic
- CAPTM - Calculate a cap for magic time machine and attempt to BB it.
- BR - Cast rituals from highest to lowest ignoring rituals you cant afford or will take more than an hour

Available non-cap priorities for Magic are as follows:

- NGU-X (0-6) - Allocate energy to NGU
- WAN - Allocate energy to magic wandoos
- TM - Allocate energy to magic time machine
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate magic to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate too. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

More information on allocation indexes can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## R3

An R3 breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
{
"Time": 0,
"Priorities": ["HACK-1"]
}
```

Available priorities for R3 are as follows:

- HACK-X (0-13) - Allocate R3 to hacks
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate R3 to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate too. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

## Gear

A gear breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
{
    "Time": 0,
    "ID": [189, 442, 160, 441, 148, 169, 139, 184, 187, 185, 186, 188]
}
```

The list of IDs is the IDs of the gear desired.

You can dump your loadouts from Gear Optimizer using the method found on [this wiki page](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Dump-Equipment-from-GO)

## Diggers

A digger breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
{
    "Time": 3650,
    "List": [3, 4, 5, 8]
}
```

The list of diggers is 0 indexed. Drop chance digger is 0, EXP digger is 11. More information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## Wandoos

A wandoos breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
{
    "Time": 0,
    "OS": 1
}
```

The OS is 0 indexed. Wandoos 98 is 0, Wandoos MEH is 1, Wandoos XL is 2

## Rebirth

A rebirth breakpoint is added as follows:

```
"RebirthTime": -1
```

A setting of -1 means no rebirths. Otherwise rebirth will be performed when the time in seconds is reached.

## Time setting

All times can be also defined as a strings with standard time parsing format.

#### Example usage:
```
{
    "Time": "1:10:0", // 1h 10 minutes
    "OS": 1
}
```
#### Examples of time expressions
```
//              String to Parse                  TimeSpan
//            -----------------   -----------------------
//                          "0"        00:00:00
//                         "14"     14.00:00:00 (14 days)
//                      "1:2:3"        01:02:03
//                "10.20:30:40"     10.20:30:40
//             "0023:0059:0059"        23:59:59
//                     "23:0:0"        23:00:00
//                     "24:0:0"   Parse operation failed.
//                     "0:59:0"        00:59:00
//                     "0:60:0"   Parse operation failed.
//                     "0:0:59"        00:00:59
//                     "0:0:60"   Parse operation failed.
//                       "10:0"        10:00:00
